TITLE: Negotiating Visibility for Safe Autonomous Navigation in Occluding and Uncertain Environments

In this video, we demonstrate our Gaussian process-based runtime planning, replanning and recovery for safe navigation with unknown payload mass disturbance on an Asctec Hummingbird quadrotor. We use Gaussian Process regression to estimate the payload that the vehicle is carrying and to decide the average desired speed for the quadrotor to safely navigate through a window-shaped obstacle. We show eight different flights where the quadrotor is able to find a speed to safely complete its task while carrying different payloads. At 00:55, we show a case in which the quadrotor needs to perform a recovery and replanning to be able to go through the obstacle and at 01:04 we show a case where the system moves with the maximum speed without using the proposed approach resulting into unsafe states. The position of the window, the actual and estimated payload values and speed decision are displayed on the left corner of the video.
