TITLE: Negotiating Visibility for Safe Autonomous Navigation in Occluding and Uncertain Environments

%Description: The video contains the experiments performed with a quadrotor UAV that demonstrate our Gaussian process-based fast planning, recovery and replanning under unknown payload mass disturbance.
Description: The video contains the experiments performed with a Clearpath Jackal UGV that demonstrate how the proposed framework maneuvers to gain visibility around occlusions in different scenarios.

Player Information: This video can be played with any video player which supports .mp4 file format such as 'Windows Media Player 12', 'VLC Media Player', 'QuickTime Player'
